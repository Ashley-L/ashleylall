                    <p class="normal-text">Raywater Cottage Resort was developed for my Brand and Marketing course in my second year at GBC (Sept-Dec 2019).</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">The goal of this project was to build a brand for a fictiona client who owned a 50-year old family summer cottage resort in Muskoka. This included name, logo, brand features, imagery, social media, and website design.</p>

                            <p class="normal-text">The first step to creating this brand was to do market research on who visited Muskoka in the summer, what were the core attractors of the area, and who were my direct competitors. Many Muskoka resorts called themselves kid-friendly – they had activities to keep children busy while parents could relax. Raywater would aim to be an escape not just for the adults, but for the family as a whole. Raywater would be a place to recharge with loved ones, and this idea lent itself to light, soft, and relaxing colours and imagery.</p>

                            <p class="normal-text">The next step was naming the resort. This involved drawing inspiration from every part of Muskoka – from activities, to history, to culture. I wanted the name to be meaningful rather than just random nature-related words strung together. Looking into more imagery of Muskoka lakes was what eventually led to the name – sun glitter, the sparkle of the sun’s rays on rippling water, inspired ‘Raywater.’</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">This entire process was a huge learning experience for me as this was my first attempt at developing a brand from scratch. I learned a lot about how careful combinations of colours, lines, and fonts can completely change the tone of a brand. The knowledge I’ve gained from developing this work over the course of a semester will be applicable both UX and UI roles I may take on in the future.</p>
