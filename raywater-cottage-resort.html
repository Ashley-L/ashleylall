                <p class="normal-text">Raywater Cottage Resort was developed for my Brand and Marketing course in my second year at GBC (Sept-Dec 2019).</p>
                
                <h2 class="subheading-small">Client</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">The goal of this project was to develop an updated brand for a client who owned a 50-year old family summer cottage resort in Muskoka. Because the client was fictious, this essentially required creating a brand from scratch. This included name, logo, brand features, imagery, social media, and website design.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Process</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">Before any designing could take place, I had to do my market. This included learning about everything there was to know about Muskoka’s cottage industry: who visited Muskoka in the summer, what were the core attractors of the area, and who were my direct competitors?d</p>

                    <img class="image" src="img/raywater_persona.png" alt="Persona from market research">
                    <figcaption class="caption normal-text">Persona from market research.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="normal-text">Market research helped me determine how I wanted Raywater to stand out. Many Muskoka resorts called themselves kid-friendly – they had activities to keep children busy while parents could relax. Raywater would aim to be the opposite of that. It would be an escape not just for the adults, but for the family as a whole. Raywater would be a place to recharge with loved ones, and this idea lent itself to a light, soft, and relaxing colour palette and imagery. </p>

                    <figcaption class="caption normal-text">Relaxation moodboard.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="normal-text">The next step was naming the resort. This involved drawing inspiration from every part of Muskoka – from activities, to history, to culture. I wanted the name to be meaningful rather than just random nature-related words strung together. Aspen was a front-runner for quite some time, in reference to quaking aspens, which would evoke the imagery of trees swaying gently in the breeze. Upon further research, however, Aspen was already the name of a Colorado ski resort and these trees did not seem to be found much in Muskoka.</p>

                    <figcaption class="caption normal-text">Name brainstorming.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="normal-text">Looking into more imagery of lakes of Muskoka was what eventually led to the name – sun glitter, the sparkle of the sun’s rays on rippling water, inspired ‘Raywater.’</p>
           
                <p class="normal-text">Logo design and font choices were a big hurdle for me. When I had designed the initial batch of logos, I knew something was wrong when I felt like Raywater was an accounting firm rather than a cottage resort. The colours and font were too cold for something that was supposed to be cozy and friendly. I went back to my sketches and decided to develop the ideas that consisted of imagery – water and sun and trees. This organic imagery coupled with a handwritten font had a much more welcoming tone than the original logo ideas.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p class="normal-text">Finally, I was tasked with designing the homepage for Raywater’s website. I made sure to use soft colours and ensured that the imagery was varied but would include families spending time together. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">I will be the first to be admit that this was a very difficult project. The entire process was a huge learning experience for me, as this was not just a rebrand, but the creation of an entirely new brand. I previously mentioned that I had struggled with the logo design, but I learned so much about how careful combinations of colours, lines, and fonts can completely change the tone of a brand. The knowledge I’ve gained from developing this work over the course of a semester will be applicable both UX and UI roles I may take on in the future. </p>
