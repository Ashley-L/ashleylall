                <p class="normal-text">Project Disclosure was produced for my Immersive Environments and Spatial Sense
                    class in my second year at GBC (Jan-Apr 2020). We had originally intended to make a physical
                    structure that would be displayed in a student version of a Smart City Playground developed in
                    conjunction with my school and the ThinkFresh Group, but production became digital after we went
                    into lockdown due to COVID-19.</p>
                <!-- <img src="https://picsum.photos/250/" alt="project image"> -->

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Problem</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">The challenge presented to us at the beginning of the term was to design
                    something that would allow citizens to make informed choices about their participation in a smart
                    city. My team of five decided to explore this question within the realm of safety, security, and
                    surveillance in the smart city. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Solution</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">In response to the brief, our design question became ‘how might we inform people
                    about the nature of data collection in smart cities?’ Project Disclosure was the answer to this, a
                    method to reveal, to disclose, that data collection was ubiquitous and privacy did not truly exist
                    in public space. Knowing this would help citizens make informed choices about their participation in
                    the smart city.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Process</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">Our precedent research on smart city surveillance led us to Autonomous Data
                    Machines (ADMs), security robots that patrolled the streets collecting personal data like our faces
                    and our voices without our consent. Our interest in this accepted lack of consent led us to our
                    design question.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">The ADMs were the major focus of our concept development. We wanted to collect
                    the data of people who interacted with our system to simulate how the city collects data from the
                    people that exist within it. These early ideas included 360-degree cameras, audio recorders, and
                    thermal sensors. </p>

                    <figcaption class="caption normal-text">Initial sketches during concept development.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="normal-text">As these projects were originally intended to be displayed at our Year End Show, we planned on recording visitors and displaying this audio and visual data in a cage to reflect the idea that you can see but not touch your own personal data. We would place a camera in the venue and play the live recordings on a screen inside the cage. Similarly, we would use a microphone to record audio that would also be played from a speaker in the cage. </p>

                    <figcaption class="caption normal-text">Sketch of our finalized concept.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Production</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">Before we could actually produce anything, our school was locked down and we switched to online learning. To make our project digital, we modeled the concept in Maya and created simulated interaction in a CoSpaces virtual environment. At a professor’s suggestion, we decided to look into including YOLO object detection to simulate the feeling of being watched since we were no longer making a physical system.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">My role</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">I guided my team’s discussions and kept us on track in terms of work delegation and deadlines. I was also the go-to person when it came to communicating our ideas to faculty during check-in sessions.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">As for specific work, I was responsible for setting up the YOLO open-sourced
                    software with Python, as well as to develop the CoSpaces digital submission with some light use
                    TypeScript and code blocks.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading-small">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="normal-text">Our class’s projects were showcased in a digital component of GBC’s Year End Show. I
                    presented our work on behalf of my team to faculty and students, and it was well-received.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="normal-text">Aside from the occasional faculty check-in, we worked on this project
                    independently, so I had the opportunity to learn about the natural design process and the ongoing
                    problem-solving that takes place. This project showed me the different types of problems designers
                    come across, whether it was regarding the logic of the concept narrative or the technology we were
                    using. This was also my first time working with Python, and though this specific project required
                    simply setting up a virtual environment for the code, I’m still quite proud that I was able to make it work. </p>
