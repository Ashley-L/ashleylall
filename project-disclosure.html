                    <p class="normal-text">Project Disclosure was produced for my Immersive Environments and Spatial Sense class in my second year at GBC (Jan-Apr 2020). We had originally intended to make a physical structure that would be displayed in a student version of a Smart City Playground, but production became digital after we went into lockdown due to COVID-19.</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">I was responsible for setting up the object detection component with YOLO and Python, as well as developing our digital submission. I guided my team’s discussions and kept us on track in terms of work delegation and deadlines. I was also the go-to person when it came to communicating our ideas to faculty during check-in sessions.</p>

                            <p class="normal-text">Our challenge was to design something that would allow citizens to make informed choices about their participation in a smart city. Each team would display their work on a plinth, and all the work when viewed together would represent the smart city. My team of five decided to explore this question through the lens of safety, security, and surveillance in the smart city.

                            <!-- <h2 class="subheading-small">Solution</h2> -->
                            <p class="normal-text">In response to the brief, our design question became ‘how might we inform people about the nature of data collection in smart cities?’ Project Disclosure was the answer to this, a method to reveal - to disclose - that data collection was ubiquitous and privacy did not truly exist in public space. Knowing this would help citizens make informed choices about their participation in the smart city.

                        <p class="normal-text">Our precedent research on smart city surveillance led us to Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs), security robots that patrolled the streets collecting personal data like our faces and our voices without our consent. These machines informed our design question.</p>
                        <p class="normal-text">The ADMs were the major focus of our concept development. We wanted to collect the data of people who interacted with our installation to simulate how the city collects data from the people who exist within it. These early ideas included 360-degree cameras, audio recorders, and thermal sensors. </p>

                        <p class="normal-text">As these projects were originally intended to be displayed at our Year End Show, we planned on recording visitors and displaying this audio and visual data in a cage to reflect the idea that you can see but not touch your own personal data. We would place a camera in the venue and play the live recordings on a screen inside the cage. Similarly, we would use a microphone to record audio that would also be played from a speaker in the cage. </p>

                    <p class="normal-text">As these projects were originally intended to be displayed at our Year End Show, we planned on recording visitors with cameras and microphones hidden around the room and displaying data in a cage to reflect the idea that you can see but not touch your own personal data.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">Before we could actually produce anything, our school was locked down and we switched to online learning. To make our project digital, we modeled the components in Maya and created simulated interaction in a CoSpaces virtual environment. At a professor’s suggestion, we decided to look into including YOLO object detection to simulate the feeling of being watched since we were no longer making a physical system.</p>

                    <p class="normal-text">Our class’s projects were showcased in a virtual component of GBC’s Year End Show.</p>
                    <p class="normal-text">This project was a great opportunity to learn about the natural design process and the ongoing problem-solving that takes place. I learned about the different types of problems designers come across, whether it was the logic of the concept narrative or the technology we were using. This was also my first time working with Python, and though this specific project required simply setting up a virtual environment for the code, I’m still quite proud that I was able to make it work with zero background experience.</p>
